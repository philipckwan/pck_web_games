The difference between the frontend react and the backend express.
is because react is ES, while node express is commonJS

"...The difference between import and require is require is for Node.JS, and import is a Javascript/ECMAScript standard..."

finally, what i did was to have both .js and .mjs file available
where .mjs is the original file, and .js is a symlink to it.

i.e. for the common shared library (battleship_shared_lib) to work:

Philips-MBP:src philip$ pwd
/Users/philip/workspaces/workspace-git/pck_web_games/battleship/battleship_shared_lib/src
Philips-MBP:src philip$ ls -l
total 16
lrwxr-xr-x  1 philip  staff    13 Feb 10 18:05 GameModel.js -> GameModel.mjs
-rw-r--r--  1 philip  staff  1028 Feb 10 16:27 GameModel.mjs
lrwxr-xr-x  1 philip  staff    18 Feb 10 18:03 PCKUtilsClient.js -> PCKUtilsClient.mjs
-rw-r--r--  1 philip  staff   760 Feb 10 18:04 PCKUtilsClient.mjs
Philips-MBP:src philip$ 

server side has to add this to package.json:
  "type": "module",
